# Crop Recommendation using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project focuses on recommending suitable crops to grow in a particular farm for cultivation based on various environmental factors. The dataset used for this analysis is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset).

## Dataset Details

The dataset is created by augmenting rainfall, climate, and fertilizer data available for India. It includes the following key fields:

- **N (Nitrogen):** Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
- **P (Phosphorous):** Ratio of Phosphorous content in soil
- **K (Potassium):** Ratio of Potassium content in soil
- **Temperature:** Soil temperature in degrees Celsius
- **Humidity:** Relative humidity in percentage
- **pH Value:** pH value of the soil
- **Rainfall:** Amount of rainfall in millimeters
